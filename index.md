Hello, 

Welcome to my professional page where you can learn more about my skills, experience, and talents. I have been a software engineer for over 25 years with a primary focus on embedded systems. The contents here are intended to supplement my resume and present a more detailed picture of my professional abilities.

Thanks for visiting!
